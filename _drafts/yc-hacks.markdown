title: "YC Hacks"

I got the opportunity this weekend to attend YC Hacks, YCombinator's first hackathon at their Mountain View, CA office. I applied to the hackathon really unsure if I had a chance to get an invitation and even when I received my invitation, I was still unsure if it would be worthwhile for me to attend. I was nervous about being able to find a team and intimidated by the impressive group of people attending the hackathon. In the end, it was an amazing experience and I'm very glad I went. 

Before the hackathon
- Pre-hackthon meetup
	- arranging that long distance was interesting
	- getting Dave's help to secure location and free food from a cool food truck (was yummy but Austin definitely has better tacos, just saying)
	- meeting a lot of attendees and learning about them in a low-pressure environment
	- ZeroCater's office was cool!
- Caltrain ride to Mt View
	- met up with a few attendees - iOS dev and guy hacking on Oculus VR
	- it was great to talk with like-minded young tech/startup people
	- talked about working at startups, starting own startup, self driving cars, VR

Finding a team
- talking to others about looking for a team and what I do for my current startup = found an awesome team
- content marketing space
- travel (which I love and am very interested in)
- looking for another Rails dev
- led by someone with YC and startup experience 
- a designer! (anyone who's been to a hackathon knows how hard it is to find a designer to join your team)
- everyone was a little older and experienced
- willing to stick together, keep working on a project afterwards

Day 1
- So many people!
- Impressed by the diversity and I thanked Sam for that when I talked to him later
	- age, race, gender, backgrounds (Ivy Leaguers, self taught)
	- There was even a line for the women's bathroom when I went!
- Good, healthy food too, though they had late night pizza as well
- Yes, there was a t-shirt cannon and a bouncy house 
	- I thought they were fun, unique bits even though I was too busy hacking to participate
	- didn't really see them as extension of toxic tech culture as some women in tech that I really admire did
- Very well run and great wifi & power
- met Alexis! who with his hipmunk experience gave us valuable advice, ideas and encouragement
- figured out the scope of what we wanted to do pretty quickly and knew everyone's strengths so everyone had a role

Day 2
- met Justin Kan
- ran into unexpected difficulties so made a back up plan for the expo
- talked to PG and Jessica & they were very encouraging
	- Paul said with my product sense and technical skills, wouldn't be surprised if I became a successful founder
- pitched to founders who had gone through YC who helped us form an angle of how to pitch to the YC partners and judges
- at the expo, I personally pitched to Sam Altman, Aaron Levie, Paul B - scary but went for it after some practice
- we got very good feedback from the judges 
	- PG mentioned he would've liked to use something like this on a recent trip to Houston
- we weren't a finalist but enjoyed it all the same
	- favored the experience over the end result
